## Contributing ##

It's a good idea to describe what it is you would like to implement before
starting it.  The are multiple reasons for this:

 - new feature might interact with other feature in ways you don't expect;
 - not all ways of implementing a feature are equal, some might be preferred
   just for the sake of keeping things consistent;
 - the code base is quite large and stuff that's already there might save you
   some time.

Changes can be sent as a pull request on [github][github] or as a patch via
[email][email].

Some information on development is available on the [wiki][wiki].

## Tests ##

Tests are available and can be run with `make check` in the root, `src/` or
`tests/` directory.  When inside `tests/`, there are multiple ways to run
specific tests in several different modes, see comment inside the `Makefile`
there for instructions.
