TODO until I populate it again...

Just to give you an idea: zshell, because it's awesome, Oh-My-Zsh, but minimalized and locked so we
don't have to be annoyed with update notices ( _I_ decide when stuff needs an update, okay?)
Then we have a bunch of shortcuts and handy functions available in both bash and zshell, custom
themes and colors, and of course, last but not least, custom editor.

Not only do I "use vim btw", I build my own vim from source.
Vim, vim file manager (vifm), curses, and a bunch of other utilities are all built from their
releases or sources.

Some other tools have decent coverage in their release binaries, so we just download those, save
ourselves some time.

## Getting started

Run `make` or `make WORKERS=$PARALLEL_WORKERS`.
