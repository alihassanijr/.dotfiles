# This script initializes anaconda, if it finds an anaconda install
# Depending on what server/computer I'm on, anaconda might be installed in one of 
# many possible directories. This script looks those up based on username and
# picks the first one it finds.

# The reason why I keep it out of my bashrc/zshrc is that in some scenarios,
# I actually don't want conda, or at least not by default.
# For instance, on my mac conda init takes 1 or 2 seconds, and I don't even use it
# that often. On login nodes I definitely don't want to have conda, because I want
# to be forced to set up my entire environment in a compute node.
#
# If I need conda but it's not initialized, I can always do `source cnda`
